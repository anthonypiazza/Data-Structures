 > NOTE: The quickest and easiest way to reliably import a file in Python is to just copy and paste the file you want to import into the same directory as the file that wants to import. This obviously isn't considered best practice, but it is the most reliable way to do it across all platforms.  If the import isn't working, feel free to try this method.


### Binary Search Trees
* Should have the methods `insert`, `contains`, `get_max`.
  * `insert` adds the input value to the binary search tree, adhering to the rules of the ordering of elements in a binary search tree.
  * `contains` searches the binary search tree for the input value, returning a boolean indicating whether the value exists in the tree or not.
  * `get_max` returns the maximum value in the binary search tree.
  * `for_each` performs a traversal of _every_ node in the tree, executing the passed-in callback function on each tree node value. There is a myriad of ways to perform tree traversal; in this case any of them should work.

### Heaps
* Should have the methods `insert`, `delete`, `get_max`, `_bubble_up`, and `_sift_down`.
  * `insert` adds the input value into the heap; this method should ensure that the inserted value is in the correct spot in the heap
  * `delete` removes and returns the 'topmost' value from the heap; this method needs to ensure that the heap property is maintained after the topmost element has been removed. 
  * `get_max` returns the maximum value in the heap _in constant time_.
  * `get_size` returns the number of elements stored in the heap.
  * `_bubble_up` moves the element at the specified index "up" the heap by swapping it with its parent if the parent's value is less than the value at the specified index.
  * `_sift_down` grabs the indices of this element's children and determines which child has a larger value. If the larger child's value is larger than the parent's value, the child element is swapped with the parent.

## Stretch Goals

### Generic Heaps
A max heap is pretty useful, but what's even more useful is to have our heap be generic such that the user can define their own priority function and pass it to the heap to use.

Augment your heap implementation so that it exhibits this behavior. If no comparator function is passed in to the heap constructor, it should default to being a max heap. Also change the name of the `get_max` function to `get_priority`.

You can test your implementation against the tests in `test_generic_heap.py`. The test expects your augmented heap implementation lives in a file called `generic_heap.py`. Feel free to change the import statement to work with your file structure or copy/paste your implementation into a file with the expected name. 

### AVL Tree
An AVL tree (Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Landis' tree, named after the inventors) is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.

We define balance factor for each node as :
```
balanceFactor = height(left subtree) - height(right subtree)
```

The balance factor of any node of an AVL tree is in the integer range [-1,+1]. If after any modification in the tree, the balance factor becomes less than âˆ’1 or greater than +1, the subtree rooted at this node is unbalanced, and a rotation is needed.

Implement an AVL Tree class that exhibits the aforementioned behavior. The tree's `insert` method should perform the same logic as what was implemented for the binary search tree, with the caveat that upon inserting a new element into the tree, it will then check to see if the tree needs to be rebalanced. 

How does the time complexity of the AVL Tree's insertion method differ from the binary search tree's?
